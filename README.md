## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Login**: Click "Login with Spotify" to authenticate via OAuth.
2. **Top Artists**: See your most-listened artists ranked with popularity scores and Spotify links.
3. **Top Tracks**: Browse your most played tracks with artist, album, and popularity info.
4. **Recently Played**: See what you've been listening to lately.
5. **Top Genres**: Visualize the genre distribution across your top artists.
6. **My Playlists**: Browse your existing Spotify playlists with track counts.
7. **Create Playlist**: Generate new playlists from top artists, top tracks, or recently played — directly from each tab.
8. **Share Stats**: Download a 1200×630 PNG card for Top Artists or Top Tracks, complete with Spotify images.

## 🔐 API Keys Required

| -------- | ----------- |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` | Spotify Developer app client ID |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Spotify Developer app client secret |
| `APP_URL` | Your app's URL (for OAuth redirect) |

Set these as environment variables or in a `.env` file.

## 🧪 Local Development

## 💡 How It Started

The inspiration for this project came from R User Group Helsinki's [workshop](https://github.com/eivicent/r-meetups-hki/tree/main/2023_03_28_SpotifyR) in March 2023. We learned to use the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) using the {spotifyr} package.

The original app relied on Spotify's audio features and recommendations APIs, which were [deprecated in November 2024](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api). TrackTeller is a complete redesign using only currently available endpoints.
